    <h2>CEG PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

    <pre>
    This Privacy Policy applies to information collected about you by the CEG Services.
    Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review our Terms 
    of Use, which governs your use of the CEG Services. By using any of the CEG Services, 
    you acknowledge the data collection practices and purposes outlined 
    in this Privacy Policy.
    </pre>

    <h3>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
    <pre>
    When you use CEG Services, we collect a few different types, or “categories,” of information. 
    This information generally falls within three broad categories: (a) the information you provide to us,
    (b) the information we collect automatically when you use our services, and (c) 
    information we obtain from other sources. We describe this information, and the primary 
    purpose for which it is used, below. The full description of how we use the personal 
    information we collect is also provided below.
    </pre>
    <h3>Information You Provide To Us</h3>
    <pre>
    CEG Services collects information you provide to us, including:
    </pre>
    <pre>
    <b>Registration Information.</b> When you register for certain services, complete any application form, 
    or enter contests or competitions, we sometimes ask you for your name, email address, postal address,
    demographic information, and any preferences that you may have (e.g., which newsletters you would 
    like to receive). We use this to provide access to certain CEG Services, 
    personalize them, and remember your preferences.

    <b>Billing and Payment Information.</b> When you 
    place an order with us or access a particular service, 
    we will collect certain payment and identity verification
    information, including your name, email address, and credit
    card information. We use this to bill you for your use of the 
    CEG Services.

    <b>Information You Post on the CEG Services.</b> We collect personal 
    information from you when you provide or post information to our 
    Services, including your user name, comments, likes, interests, 
    status, pictures and references to your online presence. We make 
    this information available to others, as you request.

    <b>Correspondence You Send Us.</b> When you contact us directly by calling
    our offices or providing feedback, comments or suggestions on programs 
    and other activities, we may collect the information you provide 
    as part of your correspondence to Us. We use this to provide services
    to you and to learn about your interests and concerns.

    <b>Information You Provide About Others.</b> Sometimes, you may provide information
    about others — for example, to refer a friend to certain CEG Services.
    We use this to make the CEG Services available to the people you refer.

    <b>Information you Provide Offline.</b> You might also provide personal 
    information to us in person and offline. You may be recorded if 
    you visit our offices (including by security surveillance of our 
    premises, including CCTV), or attend a live performance or the taping
    of one of our programs as a member of a studio audience, or, if you 
    submit sweepstakes entrance forms or an application to participate 
    in one of our programs by mail or in person. We use this information 
    to provide services to you, protect our security, and learn about 
    your preferences.
    </pre>
    <h3>Information Collected Automatically Through Cookies and Other Online Tracking Technologies</h3>
    <pre>
    We and our service providers operating on our behalf, other 
    businesses who collect information on our pages, may automatically 
    collect or receive certain information associated with you and/or your 
    device(s) as part of your use of the CEG Services through device-based 
    tracking technologies such as cookies, pixels, tags, beacons, scripts or 
    other technology. For more information about cookies and other tracking 
    technologies visit privacy.CEG/cookies. The information we collect 
    automatically includes geolocation data, such as (a) information that 
    identifies the precise location of your mobile device (when you agree 
    to allow an app to collect this) and (b) your IP address, which may 
    be used to estimate your approximate location. We use this information 
    to ensure that the CEG Services work properly, and to deliver customized 
    content and advertising, including personalized ads, to you.
    </pre>
    <h3>Information We Obtain From Other Sources</h3>
    <pre>
    The CEG Services collect information about you from other sources, 
    such as publicly available databases and other third parties that 
    have the right to share your personal information. The categories 
    of information we get from these other sources include:
    </pre>
    <h3>SECURITY</h3>
    <pre>
    We are committed to protecting your information. We have adopted commercially 
    reasonable technical, administrative, and physical procedures to help protect 
    your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, and alteration. 
    Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 
    We want you to feel confident using CEG Services but we cannot ensure or warrant the 
    security of any information you transmit to us. 
    </pre>
    <h3>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h3>
    <pre>
    We are headquartered in the United States and has affiliate offices and partners 
    in other countries. Please be aware that information you provide to us or that we 
    obtain as a result of your use of the CEG Services may be collected in your country 
    and subsequently transferred to the United States or another country in accordance 
    with applicable law. The privacy and data protection laws in the country to which 
    your information is transferred may not be equivalent to such laws in your country 
    of residence. Your personal information may be subject to the laws of the country 
    to which it is transferred and may be accessible without notice to you by the courts, 
    law enforcement and national security authorities of that country. By using and 
    participating in any CEG Services or providing us with your information, you acknowledge 
    the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of your information.
    </pre>
    <h3>PRIVACY PROTECTION OF CHILDREN</h3>
    <pre>
    Most CEG Services are intended for a general audience and do not knowingly collect 
    or store contact information about children under the age of 13 in the United States 
    or the appropriate age for services directed toward children as defined under 
    applicable laws in other jurisdictions. Some CEG Services may ask for your full 
    date of birth date to ensure that they are not collecting information from children 
    under 13 in the United States or the appropriate age for services directed toward 
    children as defined under applicable laws in other jurisdictions or to identify when 
    additional steps may need to be taken when information has been collected from children 
    under 18 or under the age of majority in their jurisdiction, if higher than 18. To read 
    about our privacy policy for children, please see the Children’s Privacy Policy at 
    <a href="cookies.html">childrensprivacypolicy.</a>
    </pre>
    <h3>THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND SERVICES</h3>
    <pre>
    Please note that some CEG Services may contain links to other websites and services. 
    We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties , and we recommend that 
    you review the privacy policies of any third party property you visit. When you select a link to a 
    third party property from one of the CEG Services (e.g., if you link to PayPal to pay for a product 
    or service offered by a CEG Service), you will be leaving the CEG Service. Any information that you 
    disclose on the third party website will be governed by that website’s privacy policy.
    </pre>
    <h3>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
    <pre>
    We will update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices and service 
    offerings. If we modify our Privacy Policy, we will update the “Last Modified Date” at the top of this 
    Privacy Policy and such changes will be effective upon posting. If we make any material changes to 
    the way we use personal information we collect, we will notify you in advance by email through the 
    email address you most recently provided to us or by prominently posting a prominent notice of the 
    changes on the CEG Services. We will not use information we have already collected in a different way 
    than we have described here, without your consent.
